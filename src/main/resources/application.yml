# Here we configure various schedules that we would like applied to groups of lightbulbs
light-schedules:

  # Name of a lights group as stored on the Hue
  - group: xyz

    # On which days do we want the application to control our light bulbs - like an alarm clock
    days_of_week:
      - Mo
      - Tue
      - Wed
      - Thu
      - Fri

    # We define the steps of the schedule like keyframes in an animation.
    # Those keyframes are defined through light scenes.
    # a.lux will look for scenes with the specified names on the Hue.
